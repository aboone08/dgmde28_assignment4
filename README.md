### Question
#### a) What was the API you used â€“ and why (include the url to the source)

I used the following API: https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/home</ul>
I chose this API because I did a simple search for a random word generator and this was the first result that Google displayed. After taking a look I saw how I could easily limit the length of the generated word which is a requirement for this assignment to max out at a length of five.


#### b) What was the most satisfying part of this assignment?

I enjoyed playing around with setting up the API and getting the code to work. I also played around with the wordle app itself and with additional time I would like to see how adding animation and getting testing my hand at the css to get the UI to match the wordle app.
